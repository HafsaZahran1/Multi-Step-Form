# WelcomeðŸ˜ƒ 
In this project I learned about how to create multi-step form.

# What is Multi-Step Form and when should we use it?
Usually when a site wants some data from its user they ask them to fill out a form with the data required. Sometimes data tends to be more than usual which in return makes the form look huge, but the problem arises when the user get intimidated by the length of form to tackle with this situation we use Multi-Step form.

Multi-step form is nothing but a single lengthy form broken into multiple pieces.

## Tools used:
